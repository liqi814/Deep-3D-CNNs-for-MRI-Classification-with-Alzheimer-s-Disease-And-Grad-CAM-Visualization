# Deep 3D CNNs for MRI Classification with Alzheimer's Disease And Grad-CAM for Visualization

This implemented paper is based on the work [Residual and Plain Convolutional Neural Networks for 3D Brain MRI Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06643) and [Visual Explanations From Deep 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Alzheimer's Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02544), and their implementation in [resnet_cnn_mri_adni](https://github.com/neuro-ml/resnet_cnn_mri_adni) and [3DCNN-Vis](https://github.com/west-gates/3DCNN-Vis). Please cite properly if you are using code in this repo.

And also the pre-processing codes for 3D MRI data are also provided stp by step in my github, please check [this link](https://github.com/liqi814/Structural-Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging-sMRI-Pre-processing-Pipeline) if you need.
